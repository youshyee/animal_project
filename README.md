# Video Animal Detection 
## Have been done
### 1 Finetuning the COCO pre-trained YOLO V3 detector for animal detection
### 2 Bootstrapping based on optical flow detection
### 3 Finetuning the YOLO model again based on the bootstrap
### 4 Applying YOLO with low IoU threthod and without NMS for getting frame-level region proposals
### 5 Applying Viterbi algorithm combining the frame-level proposals to generate tubelets 
### 6 Tubelets nonmaximum suppression.

## TO DO LIST
### 1 Robust to occluded and blurred frames for animal detection by aggreating temporal feature into YOLO feature
### 2
